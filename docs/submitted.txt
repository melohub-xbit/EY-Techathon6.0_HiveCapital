Problem statement you wish to address and why 
(Provide detailed explanation)
Problem Statement:
The NBFC wants to improve its sales success rate for personal loans by using an AI-driven conversational approach.
Why it matters:
90%+ of India’s market expects instant, conversational, multi-lingual financial engagement
Top NBFCs need a scalable, compliant, reliable solution to deliver genuine sales uplift

Industry Challenge:
Large NBFCs are struggling to convert qualified website leads into loan sales at massive scale due to:
Inflexible, impersonal chatbots—no empathy, no upsell, high abandonment
Fragmented loan journeys—manual KYC, slow underwriting, missed cross-sell
Multilingual digital population excluded by English-only tools
High regulatory and security hurdles (data localization, compliance, audit)
Lack of explainability in current GenAI solutions
Strategic Goal:
Redefine the loan sales process with an AI workforce that is more persuasive, more compliant, and more scalable than any human team in India—delivering seamless, personalized, auditable, and omnichannel journeys in every Indian language, with industry-leading productivity, trust, and profitability.
